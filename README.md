## Cracked Quiz Portal 
This portal is a simple and silly portal without any CSS. The movement you execute "quiz.html" in your browser you will only be able to solve it in the same tab.  

**Neither will you be able to minimize the tab or open another tab to cheat (It will alert you that you have cheated)**    

My main aim in creating this portal is that you learn with your techniques with real feel of Secure Tests to overcome such instances.   

*So all the best, and find your way out of not getting caught*
